# Connect4

This is a simple 2 player Connect-4 game. There are 3 modes, the classic Connect-4, a custom mode where the two players can choose their markers, and an ultimate mode where markers are indistinguishable and players will have to rememeber where they have made their moves.
This is not an online game, playres will have to use the same computer.
